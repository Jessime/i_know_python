# I know Python

A quick test to see if you have as much Python experience as you think you do.

## Installation

Just run:

```
$ pip install i_know_python
```

## Usage

This package installs a command line utility. After you install with pip, run:

```
$ i_know_python
```

You should get a prompt that looks like:

```
Welcome to 'I know Python'!
Answer these questions to the best of your ability.

Have you used:
	 string â€” Common string operations
[y/n]? 

```

Respond by entering `y` or `n`. 

There's no "I don't know" option, so take your best guess. 
There are 240 modules in this test, so it will take a few minutes.

## Motivation

Sometime I meet people who say, "Oh, yeah. I _know_ Python." 
And, if I'm honest, sometimes that person is me.
But, it's important to remember that knowing a language includes knowing its ecosystem and tooling.
One of the best things about Python is its huge user base, after all.
This quick test doesn't even get arround to testing your knowledge of third-party libraries.
It's just a quick quiz to put you in your place about your experience relative to Pythons:
"Batteries included." philosophy.

### Personal results

As of creating this README, it looks like I've used 79 modules. 
So, I've touched less than half of Python's standard library.

There's a lot left to learn!
